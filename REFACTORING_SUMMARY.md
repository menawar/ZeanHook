# ZeanHook Contract Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The original monolithic `zeanhook.sol` contract (1,224 lines) has been successfully refactored into a modular architecture with the following components:

## Refactored Structure

### 1. Storage Layer
- **`src/libraries/ZeanHookStorage.sol`** - Contains all structs, constants, and storage mappings

### 2. Interface Layer  
- **`src/interfaces/IZeanHook.sol`** - Defines the external interface for the main contract

### 3. Manager Contracts (Abstract)
- **`src/libraries/VolatilityManager.sol`** - Handles price tracking and volatility calculations
- **`src/libraries/BatchManager.sol`** - Manages batch processing of swaps
- **`src/libraries/CommitRevealManager.sol`** - Implements commit-reveal scheme for secure ordering

### 4. Main Contract
- **`src/ZeanHook.sol`** - Main contract that inherits from all managers and implements BaseHook

## Key Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify and extend individual features
3. **Readability**: Much cleaner and more organized code structure
4. **Testability**: Each manager can be tested independently
5. **Gas Optimization**: Enables more targeted optimizations

## Current Status

The refactoring is largely complete, but there are some inheritance conflicts to resolve:

### Issues to Fix:
1. **Hook Function Overrides**: The BaseHook functions need proper override handling
2. **Multiple Inheritance**: Some functions exist in multiple base contracts and need disambiguation

### Working Components:
- ✅ Storage layer properly defined
- ✅ Manager contracts with their respective functionality
- ✅ Interface definitions cleaned up
- ✅ Modular architecture established

## Next Steps

1. Resolve the BaseHook inheritance conflicts
2. Fix any remaining function override issues  
3. Add comprehensive tests for each manager
4. Optimize gas usage in individual managers
5. Add proper documentation for each component

The refactoring has successfully reduced complexity and improved maintainability. The original 1,224-line monolithic contract is now organized into focused, manageable components.
